I've been careful to try to make this website ass accessible as possible. I've done this by:
<li>Ensuring that I use the correct semantic HTML,</li>
<li>Using alt attributes on images that are descriptive,</li>
<li>Using the aria-label attribute when using icons,</li>
<li>By using colors that have strong contrast.</li>

I used GitHub Pages to deploy the website. This is how I did it:
<ol>

<li>I went to the settings menu.</li>
<li>I clicked on the Pages tab on the navigation bar.</li>

 </ol><a href=>Rock Paper Scissors</a>

 ### Local Deployment
Inorder to Fork the Rock Paper Scissors repository I logged into GitHub, then found the Rock Paper Scissors repository and then clicked on the Fork button.
<br>For me to Clone the Golden Age page I logged in to GitHub, went to the repository for this project.
I then clicked on the code button, selected whether I would like to clone with HTTPS, SSH or GitHub CLI and copied the link shown.
I opened the terminal in my code editor and changed the current working directory to the location I wanted to use for the cloned directory. I then typed git clone into the terminal and then pasted the link I copied earlier. You need a http server installed.
